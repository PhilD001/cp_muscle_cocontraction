# cp_muscle_cocontraction

This repository contains sample code and data to compute muscle co-contaction as described in the manuscript "MUSCLE COACTIVATION 
DURING GAIT IN CHILDREN WITH AND WITHOUT CEREBRAL PALSY"

## Dataset : 
As we are unable to share the patient dataset associated with the 
paper, here we demonstrate the code with a subset of control data 
(typically developping children) included in this repository


## Prerequisites
- Requires biomechZoo repo (tested using v 1.9.8): https://github.com/PhilD001/biomechZoo
- This repo, stored at https://github.com/PhilD001/cp_muscle_cocontraction

## How to run
- Add the biomechZoo toolbox to your Matlab path
- Add this repository to your Matlab path
